 //C++ Compiler :
 // Once you have installed text-editor and typed and save your
//  program in a file with ‘.CPP’ extension, you will need a C++ 
//  compiler to compile this file. A compiler is a computer program
//  which converts high-level language into machine understandable
//  low-level language. In other words, we can say that it converts
//  the source code written in a programming language into
//   another computer language which the computer understands. For
//    compiling a C++ program we will need a C++ compiler which 
//   will convert the source code written in C++ into machine codes.
//   Below are the details about setting up compiler on different platforms.
